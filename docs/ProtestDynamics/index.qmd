1. Operationalizing a Predator-Prey Model

2. Dynamic Time-Warping

3. An Application to India

## Dynamic Time-Warping

1. Merge the paths by a minimum distance estimator.

2. Use k-means to cluster the warped series

3. An ARIMA solution, or four of them ARIMA and DARIMA with X.

## Some Questions:

Why not continuous time models?  Simultaneous equations in continuous time is the predator-prey origin.

1. Advice on windows and number of clusters?  Could the data sort the second one?

2. How do we defend the shifting and warping if the timing of events is the crucial piece?

3. Why MSE?  MAD, MAPE and the like might be better.

4. The forecasting literature has some excess zero solutions, did you consider them?

5. What is in the X variants of ARIMA and how do they enter?

## Some Comments

1. Drop digits in Table 1.

2. There's a hidden VAR here.  You can use it to test Granger causality.

3. Does this mean each forecast is one-step?

4. Did you consider auto-ARIMA for forecasts at scale?

5. What does warping mean for understanding dependence as we are changing the metric of time, no?

6. The D seems to do very little in *AX models.
