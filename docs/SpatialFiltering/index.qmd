1. Space
   
2. Three Common Approaches: They focus on the middle case.

3. The Innovation: Eigenvector Spatial Filtering [ESF]

4. Monte Carlo Studies

## The Good: A Crucial Problem We Wave Our Hands At

This is an efficient paper that hones in on and solves a clear problem.

1. Marginalize space: integrate it out.

2. Like really do it; solve the problem for GLMs with linear regression as a special case.  But, generalized residuals....

## The Magic Filter

A better explanation of what inputs and what is being calculated would help here.  Perhaps a walk-through example.

## Some Questions:

1. When and how does it matter?

2. How well does this work with generalized residuals?  Personally, I think the Monte Carlo for that case would be far more interesting.

3. Substantively, what does the ESF tell us?

4. Any intuition for why the different results come from different criteria?

## Some Nits to Pick

1. cubic polynomials of time (Beck, Katz and Tucker, 1998) is Carter/Signorino
